Here in the shell permission task given to us by the ALX-SE team, our assignment is to creat scripts and describe what each script does;

 Task 0 :My name is betty; the "su betty" command is used to switch user to betty

 Task 1 :Who am I; the "whoami" command is used to determine the effective username of the current user

task 2 :Groups; the "groups" command is used to print out all groups which a user is a part of.
