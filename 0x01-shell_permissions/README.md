Here in the shell permission task given to us by the ALX-SE team, our assignment is to creat scripts and describe what each script does;

1. Task:My name is betty; the "su betty" command is used to switch user to betty
2. Task:Who am I; the "whoami" command is used to determine the effective username of the current user
